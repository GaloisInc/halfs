Programs using HFuse should be compiled with -threaded.

HelloFS seems to work with:
* Linux 2.6.24
* The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.8.2
* fuse-2.6

BindFS (?) is known to have a lurking deadlock problem.

LiveFS is broken (from the old distribution).

Added support for MacFUSE. Tested HelloFS and BindFS with:
* OSX 10.4.11 on a PPC G4 mac
* GHC 6.8.3
* MacFUSE 10.4-1.7.0

Galois:

JS 03 Mar 2009: I've tweaked the cabal file a bit and the current
version builds and works (for HelloFS at least) on:

* OS X 10.5.8 on a 64 bit Intel Mac
* GHC 6.10.4
* MacFUSE 2.0.3 

Checking the darcs repo into git (wha!?) as well so we can easily submit
patches later if we so choose.
